This scad library makes models of entire cartridges or just bullets.
You can use it to make dummy rounds or dummy bullets or use as models in other openscad projects. Dimensions for ammo can be found from wikipedia. Dimensions are in mm.

# Functions:
makeCartridge(cartridge, bulletType, boatTail, bulletOnly)<strong<

for example: makeCartridge("9mm","pistolhollowpoint", false, false);

This creates a 9mm cartridge complete with a hollowpoint bullet. If bulletOnly is true, it will create a dummy bullet to be inserted into a empty casing. This is useful for creating dummy rounds.dfadf
